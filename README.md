# coalition-assessment
 This submission is my skills test for the front-end position at Coalition Technologies. The goal is to convert an Adobe Photoshop file into a responsive single-page web app, ensuring adaptability across screen sizes. Internal links for 'History' and 'Team' are included, with a desktop parallax scrolling effect.
